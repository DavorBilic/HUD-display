# HUD-display

1. VERSION (ARDUINO NANO AND LCD DISPLAY)
Information about the distances of a certain object from the ultrasonic sensor are printed at the top of the screen
(Distance: ... cm). The absolute orientation sensor BNO055 displays the Euler vector (x,y,z axis), which is printed 
below the distance. Using the Euler vector, an artificial horizon was made.
